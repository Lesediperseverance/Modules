# Modules
The program will have to be able to store which modules a student is doing, Every module is worth a specific number of credits and that number multiplied by 10 will be the number of hours 
spent on it throughout the semester. For example, PROG6212 is 15 credits, so 150 hours should  be spent on it. Some of that will be in class, and the rest will have to be distributed throughout the weeks. For starters you add a new class: Whenever you get a new class, you open your notebook and write down its code, name, points, and weekly hours. It's like adding a new game to your collection. You furthermore, record your study time: When you sit down to study for one of your classes, you write down how long you studied and the date. This helps you remember how much you worked on each class. Check how much time you have left: You can also ask the program, "How much more time do I have to study?" It calculates that for you. It looks at how many points your class is worth, how long your semester is, and how many hours you spend in class. Then it tells you how much time you should spend studying each week.
